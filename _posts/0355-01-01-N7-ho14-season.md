description: With Nike celebrating seven years of N7 inspiration to Native American youth and collaborating with Peter Boome, a Northwest Coast artist and member of the Upper Skagit tribe, I was able to create abstract qualities of movement to the wings and other traditional elements without distorting the true storytelling within the iconic symbols thus creating a dynamic/ownable  look that’s culturally relevant, inspirational, and driven by movement.
