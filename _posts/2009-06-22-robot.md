This is a collaboration with my buddy Jim. We wanted to find a great spot to throw some work and after searching around finding many possibilities, we stumbled apon this blown out coal refinery. We checked it out and started some random painting the first day but realized this place has barely been touched and with limited time of him visiting we knew we needed to work together immediately. The next day after going over ideas we scouted the perfect room, from that point we started collecting huge pieces of steel cabinets, metal work, extinguishers, doors (there was so much stuff just left there, it was a goldmine of materials) It took about 4 days to build, paint and detail this thing. For a size example, both of us could sit in the head...huge!!!) 

The final touches were all the toxic waist barrels scattered around the room we sprayed them to look like beer cans then created a couple stencils for the logo and found actual wooden things that looked like taps for the top. Our goal for this piece was to create an idea that would look like it lives in this space. So we created this drunken robot to resemble and be a part the slow decay of this industrial era. I feel we did a hell of a job too!

While we were in the middle of working on this thing, we met a photographer that scared the crap out of us busting through one of the doors. After talking with him about the place and the piece, he was excited to come back and do some night shots when finished. He also informed us that the place was covered in asbestos and the barrels that are beer cans are actual toxic waist. Yum.
