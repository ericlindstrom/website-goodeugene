description: When you get hired there’s going to be paperwork, rules and more paperwork. Nemo wanted to take the suck out out new hire forms and create a kit of awesomeness with a twist on the expected. My role for the kit was to come up with a humerus visual guide for the “don’ts” in the work place. Inspired by Highlights magazine, this 12 rule poster turned eyes once released.
